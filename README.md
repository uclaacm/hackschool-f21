# Hackschool Resources - Fall 2021 <!-- omit in toc -->

## Welcome to Hackschool 

It's easy to feel lost in the world of tech or not know where to start. We
created Hackschool to give you a place to start in this wonderful universe of
possibilities. We wanted to fill the gaps between what is taught in class and
what is needed to build change you'd like to see in the world. By the end,
you'll have glimpsed a little bit of everything behind the websites you visit
every day.

In this repository, you'll find a guide to all the topics we introduce this
quarter, and links to helpful resources.

We hope you have a blast this quarter, and encourage you to reach out to any of
us if you have any questions or comments.

## What You'll Need for the Entire Course

* A text editor. We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as
  a default choice, but [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and
  [Atom](https://atom.io/) are also excellent choices. If you already use
  another editor, that's perfectly fine. Don't worry about using the "best"
  one; any modern editor is more than enough for what we'll tackle this
  quarter.

* Google Chrome: it has the best developer tools and the highest market share of
  any web browser
  
* Bonus item (if you have time): Create a GitHub account

### Helpful Docs & Tools

* [http://jsbin.com/](http://jsbin.com/) for quick in-browser prototypes

* [Mancy](https://github.com/princejwesley/Mancy) if you want an interactive
  JavaScript prompt (called a REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop)

* [http://codepen.io/](http://codepen.io/) to share ideas with other people

* You'll find the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) very helpful
for looking up the particulars of a built-in function or CSS property.
