Boolean:
What does this evaluate to:
(!true && false) || ((!false || !true) && true);






Types:
What will get printed in each of these questions? (Try to figure it out without actually running the code.)

console.log(1 + 11)
console.log("1" + "11")
console.log("hello" !== "HELLO")
console.log(5 === 8)
console.log(!true)
console.log((4 < 6) && (8 !== 10))










Variables:
What will get prinhted to the console in each of the questions?

let width = 10;
let height = 2;
console.log(width * height);

let iLoveAnime = true;
let animeIsGood = true;
console.log(iLoveAnime && animeIsGood);

let today = "Wednesday";
console.log("Today is " + today);

let uclaScore = 100;
let uscScore = 0;
console.log(uclaScore > uscScore);








Functions 1:
What gets printed?

const yep = (n) => {
  return n + 2;
};
const oh = (n) => {
  return n * 3;
};
const pop = (n) => {
  return n - 7;
};
const yop = (y, o, p) => {
  return yep(y) + oh(o) + pop(p);
};



console.log(yop(5, 2, 3));
const nah = (s) => {
  console.log(s + s);
};
const nope = (s) => {
  console.log(s + "!!!");
};
const no = (en, oh) => {
  nah(oh);
  nope(en);
};
no("jam", "bred");











Functions 2:
Let's write a function called animePlanner that has two arguments:

1. totalHours: how many hours I can spend on watching anime today
2. currentMinutes: the number of minutes I've already watched anime today

The function should print out how many episodes of anime I can still watch today. (Fractions of episodes is fine too). 
Each episode of anime is 20 minutes.








Conditionals 1:
You work for the new gym at UCLA Bruin Gym (bgym for short). 
You are in charge of walking around the gym periodically and
checking to see if students are wearing their masks properly in the gym. 
At any time, if you observe that less than 80% of people are not wearing their masks, 
you are required to do an announcement on the PA system.

For this exercise, write a function:
A function called checkMasks that takes in three arguments:
1. totalPeople: How many people are in the gym currently
2. maskCount: How many people are currently wearing masks
3. announcment: Some message string telling people to wear their masks

If there are more than or equal to 80% of people wearing masks, you function should print nothing and return false.
If there are less than 80% of people wearing masks, your function should print the announcment string, and then return true. 









Objects 1:
In a multiplayer video game, each player has an object like so:

const playerTenz = {
    username: "TenZ",
    health: 100,
    armor: 50
}

const playerEugene = {
    username: "euglo", // what a scrub
    health: 2,
    armor: 0
}

At any point in time, our game wants to know who currently has the highest health and armor combined.
(Health + Armor) is a directly proportional to skill. Eg. since euglo has a combined health+armor of 2, he sucks lul.
As part of this, we want to write a function playerComparison, that takes in two arguments: 

1. player1: a player object
2. player2: another player object

The function will return the username of whoever has the most health and armor combined. 
In the event that the health and armor combined are the same, we want to return the string "Equal".










Objects 2:
You are working at a Ralph's in Westwood. At 1am, some sus UCLA students pull up wanting to buy some alchohol. 
You are not sure if they are legal
or not. 
You ask the students for their ID to check their age, 
but it turns out that these students are CS nerdz - they have their ID in digital format.
Worst of all, this ID is stored as a JavaScript Object (yuck~). 

But oh well, you gotta get your job done. 
So you will need to write a JavaScript function, isLegal, that takes in an ID as an argument, and returns true if that student is over 21, 
or false if that student is below 21.

Examples of student IDs:

let id1 = {
    name: "Eugene Lo",
    DOB: new Date(1990, 11, 17)
}

let id2 = {
    name: "Asha Kar",
    DOB: new Date(1990, 11, 17)
}










Arrays 1
You are the new CS professor at UCLA.
Even though you get paid very little to teach your students (because the CS department is sh** and doesn't do anything right),
you still want to do a good job of teaching.
You devise a method of rewarding your students:
If the average of all their midterm test scores is larger than 75, then you will reward your students. 
Else, you will dish out more homework.

Write a function, calculateAverage, that takes in an array of numbers (scores), and returns the average of all the numbers.
